# CookgroupEssentials

CookgroupEssentials is a compilation of all of my sneaker related Discord bots. If you're looking to start your own cookgroup or add some new bots to a group you're already apart or you simply just want to learn Python with me, then this is for you!

Included:
- BotBrokerBot: Bot price checker for botbroker.io
- BotMartBot: Bot price checker for botmart.io
- SuggestionBot: Bot that can be used in a #suggestions channel where higher up roles can take commonly suggested topics and get votes on them
- FeeBot: Bot that calculates selling fees for a multitude of common sneaker related platforms
- TrackBot: Bot that tracks packages through Discord (more for personal use)
- RentalBot: Bot that allows users to input/view/delete bot rentals
